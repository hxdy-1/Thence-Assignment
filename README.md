## For reviewing the project:
- I have utilized Next.js which is known as best React.js framework for faster websites **(still uses react though).**
- I have used raw **CSS for animations** along with Tailwind CSS for ease of development and better UI.
- I have coded this on a 15 inch screen so it will look **pixelÂ perfect** on the same.
